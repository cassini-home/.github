## Overview:
Cassini redefines home automation with its intuitive and technically advanced interface. Designed to seamlessly configure a wide range of hardware devices through GPIO pins, Cassini is compatible with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and ESP32, and is extendable to any similar hardware interface.

### Key Features:
- User Interface: Aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, Cassini's interface allows for the straightforward setup and management of diverse hardware components.
- Hardware Integration: Users can easily describe and manage their hardware configurations, detailing connections to ensure seamless operation. Cassini automatically generates a robust API for real-time interactions with connected devices over Ethernet or WiFi.
- Communication Protocols: Supports fundamental communication protocols such as I2C, paving the way for integration with more complex sensors and devices in future updates.
- API Functionality: Offers detailed control and monitoring of each pin's state and properties, facilitating precise command over components like relays and motors.
- Modular Design: Engineered for scalability, Cassini supports zone-specific (e.g., rooms or sections) hardware implementation in a modular fashion, perfect for smart homes.
- Custom Hardware: Includes proprietary hardware components, optimized for the Cassini software, ensuring enhanced performance and reliability.

### Advanced Automation Capabilities:
- Energy Management: Integrates with various energy sources including solar, gas, and grid systems.
- Climate Control: Automated air conditioning systems for optimal environmental comfort.
- Security: Enhanced with cameras, sensors, and locks for robust home security.
- Scene Management: Allows the creation and automation of scenes for everyday activities.

### AI and Interaction:
- Voice Interaction: Features microphones and speakers in each zone for voice commands and interaction.
- Person Recognition: Advanced user recognition technology manages permissions and interactions tailored to individual preferences.
- Gesture and Spatial Interaction: Utilizes internal cameras for gesture recognition and 3D spatial interaction, enabling intuitive control over the home environment.
- Personalization: Automatic customization of music, ambient lighting, and notifications based on user presence and preferences.

### Developer Information:
Originally developed by Marcelo Mira for his residence, Cassini is now available to anyone interested in advanced home automation solutions.
